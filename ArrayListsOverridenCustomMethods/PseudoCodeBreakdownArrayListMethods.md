Here's a detailed breakdown of the pseudocode for each method in your `MyArrayList` class, similar to the explanation provided for `ensureCapacity()`:

### 1. `add(E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the array needs resizing (if size equals capacity).
- Ensure capacity (resize if necessary).
- Add the element to the array at the current `size` index.
- Increment the `size`.

**Explanation:**
- **Capacity Check and Resize**: Before adding a new element, the method checks if there is enough space in the array. If the array is full (`size` equals `capacity`), it calls `ensureCapacity()` to resize the array and increase its capacity.
- **Adding the Element**: The element is added at the position indexed by `size`, which is the next available slot in the array.
- **Incrementing Size**: After adding the element, `size` is incremented by one to reflect the addition of the new element and to update the index for the next addition.

### 2. `add(int index, E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Ensure capacity (resize if necessary).
- Shift elements from the index to the end of the array one position to the right to make space for the new element.
- Insert the new element at the specified index.
- Increment the size.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: The method first checks if the provided index is valid (i.e., it must be within the range from 0 to `size`). If the index is out of bounds, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Capacity Check and Resize**: Similar to `add(E element)`, it checks and adjusts the capacity if needed.
- **Element Shifting**: Elements from the specified index onwards are shifted one position to the right to make space for the new element. This is typically done using `System.arraycopy()`.
- **Element Insertion**: The new element is placed at the specified index.
- **Size Update**: The `size` is incremented to account for the new element.

### 3. `get(int index)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Return the element at the specified index.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: Ensures that the index is within the bounds of the array (0 to `size-1`). If not, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Element Retrieval**: Returns the element located at the specified index.

### 4. `set(int index, E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Store the old element at the index.
- Replace the old element with the new element at the specified index.
- Return the old element.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: Checks for a valid index as in `get(int index)`.
- **Element Replacement**: The existing element at the index is replaced with the new element. The old element is stored so it can be returned.

### 5. `remove(int index)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Store the element to be removed.
- Shift elements from index+1 to the end of the array one position to the left.
- Decrement the size.
- Set the last element to null (to help with garbage collection).
- Return the removed element.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation and Element Storage**: Validates the index and stores the element at that index for return.
- **Element Shifting**: Elements following the removed element are shifted left to fill the gap.
- **Size and Cleanup**: Decreases the `size` by one and clears the last element reference to prevent memory leaks.

These explanations provide a clear understanding of the operations performed by each method, ensuring that the array list manages its elements efficiently and correctly handles edge cases such as bounds checking and resizing.
