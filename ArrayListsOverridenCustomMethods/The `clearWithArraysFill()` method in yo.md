The `clearWithArraysFill()` method in your Java code will not throw an `ArrayStoreException`. This method uses `Arrays.fill(data, null)` to set all elements of the array `data` to `null`. 

An `ArrayStoreException` occurs when you try to store an element of an incompatible type into an array of objects. Since `null` is a valid value for any reference type in Java, assigning `null` to any element of an array, regardless of its component type, is allowed and does not result in an `ArrayStoreException`.

Here's a brief explanation of when an `ArrayStoreException` would typically occur:

- If you have an array declared to hold objects of a specific type (or its subtypes) and you attempt to store an object of a different, incompatible type into this array, then an `ArrayStoreException` will be thrown. 

In your provided method, since you are only assigning `null` to all elements of the array, there is no risk of this exception occurring. Thus, the method is safe from `ArrayStoreException`.

For more detailed information on `ArrayStoreException`, you can refer to the Java documentation or resources like [Oracle's Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ArrayStoreException.html).
