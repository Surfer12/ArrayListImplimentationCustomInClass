Final Notes for Java

**Review Class Diagrams and Flowcharts**
 - class diagrams are helpful for understanding the structure of a class and its methods before you start writing code.
 - flowcharts are helpful for understanding the flow of a program, including the order of execution and the flow of control.


**Class Diagrams:**

* Separation of fields and methods
* Show return types, parameters, and variables
* Show inheritance

**Important Note:**

Remember that parameters of a method are specific to that method and are obvious.

**Example Method Signature:**

```java
void setAge(int age)
```
