In the context of your `MyArrayList` implementation, incrementing the size is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data structure. Here’s why we do it:

1. **Tracking the Number of Elements**: The `size` variable keeps track of how many elements are currently stored in the array. This is important because it allows the `MyArrayList` to know how many valid entries exist, which is essential for operations like retrieval, iteration, and checking if the list is empty.

2. **Preventing Overwrites**: When you add a new element to the list, you place it at the index equal to the current `size`. If you do not increment `size` after adding an element, the next time you add an element, it would overwrite the last added element, leading to data loss.

3. **Dynamic Resizing**: In a dynamic array implementation, when the array reaches its capacity, you typically need to resize it (e.g., double its size). The `size` variable helps determine when this resizing is necessary.

4. **Consistency with Other Methods**: Other methods like `get`, `remove`, and `indexOf` rely on the `size` variable to function correctly. For example, if `size` is not updated correctly, these methods may attempt to access invalid indices, leading to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Here’s a brief example of how the `add` method might look with the increment:

```java
public void add(E element) {
    if (size >= capacity) {
        ensureCapacity(); // Resize if necessary
    }
    data[size] = element; // Add the element at the current size index
    size++; // Increment the size to reflect the addition
}
```

In this example, after adding the element, `size` is incremented to ensure that the next addition will go to the correct index. This practice helps maintain the integrity and functionality of the `MyArrayList` class.
