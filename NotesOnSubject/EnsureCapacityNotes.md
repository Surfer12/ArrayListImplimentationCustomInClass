The pseudocode in the `ensureCapacity()` method of your `MyArrayList` class describes the steps to dynamically resize the internal array (`data`) when the current number of elements (`size`) reaches the array's capacity (`capacity`). Here's a breakdown of the steps, particularly focusing on the last part about setting the data to the new array and then updating the capacity:

1. **Check if Resizing is Needed**: The method first checks if the `size` is equal to or greater than the `capacity`. If true, it indicates that there's no more space to add new elements, and the array needs to be resized.

2. **Update the Capacity**: The capacity of the array is increased. In the pseudocode, it suggests a common resizing strategy where the new capacity is calculated as `capacity * 3 / 2 + 1`. However, in your actual Java code, the capacity is simply doubled (`capacity *= 2`).

3. **Create a New Array with the New Capacity**: A new array with the updated capacity is created. This array will be used to store the existing elements and any new elements added until the next resize.

4. **Copy Elements from the Old Array to the New Array**: All the elements from the current array (`data`) are copied to the new array. This is typically done using `System.arraycopy()` in Java, but the actual copying code is not shown in your snippet.

5. **Set `data` to the New Array**: The `data` reference is updated to point to the new array. This step is crucial as it switches out the old, full array with the new, larger array that has additional space for more elements.

6. **Update `capacity` to the New Capacity**: Finally, the `capacity` variable is updated to reflect the new size of the array. This step is essential for future operations on the array, as it ensures that the capacity check (`if (size >= capacity)`) accurately represents the actual size of the array.

The last step of updating the `capacity` variable is important because it ensures that subsequent checks for resizing (in future `add` operations) correctly compare the current number of elements against the actual capacity of the array. Without this step, the `capacity` would remain at its old value, leading to incorrect behavior in managing the array's size.
