Here's a detailed breakdown of the pseudocode for each method in your `MyArrayList` class, similar to the explanation provided for `ensureCapacity()`:

### 1. `add(E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the array needs resizing (if size equals capacity).
- Ensure capacity (resize if necessary).
- Add the element to the array at the current `size` index.
- Increment the `size`.

**Explanation:**
- **Capacity Check and Resize**: Before adding a new element, the method checks if there is enough space in the array. If the array is full (`size` equals `capacity`), it calls `ensureCapacity()` to resize the array and increase its capacity.
- **Adding the Element**: The element is added at the position indexed by `size`, which is the next available slot in the array.
- **Incrementing Size**: After adding the element, `size` is incremented by one to reflect the addition of the new element and to update the index for the next addition.

### 2. `add(int index, E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Ensure capacity (resize if necessary).
- Shift elements from the index to the end of the array one position to the right to make space for the new element.
- Insert the new element at the specified index.
- Increment the size.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: The method first checks if the provided index is valid (i.e., it must be within the range from 0 to `size`). If the index is out of bounds, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Capacity Check and Resize**: Similar to `add(E element)`, it checks and adjusts the capacity if needed.
- **Element Shifting**: Elements from the specified index onwards are shifted one position to the right to make space for the new element. This is typically done using `System.arraycopy()`.
- **Element Insertion**: The new element is placed at the specified index.
- **Size Update**: The `size` is incremented to account for the new element.

### 3. `get(int index)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Return the element at the specified index.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: Ensures that the index is within the bounds of the array (0 to `size-1`). If not, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Element Retrieval**: Returns the element located at the specified index.

### 4. `set(int index, E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Store the old element at the index.
- Replace the old element with the new element at the specified index.
- Return the old element.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation**: Checks for a valid index as in `get(int index)`.
- **Element Replacement**: The existing element at the index is replaced with the new element. The old element is stored so it can be returned.

### 5. `remove(int index)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Check if the index is out of bounds.
- Store the element to be removed.
- Shift elements from index+1 to the end of the array one position to the left.
- Decrement the size.
- Set the last element to null (to help with garbage collection).
- Return the removed element.

**Explanation:**
- **Index Validation and Element Storage**: Validates the index and stores the element at that index for return.
- **Element Shifting**: Elements following the removed element are shifted left to fill the gap.
- **Size and Cleanup**: Decreases the `size` by one and clears the last element reference to prevent memory leaks.

These explanations provide a clear understanding of the operations performed by each method, ensuring that the array list manages its elements efficiently and correctly handles edge cases such as bounds checking and resizing.

### 6. `contains(E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- Iterate through each element in the list.
- If the current element equals the target element, return true.
- If no match is found after checking all elements, return false.

**Explanation:**
- **Iteration**: The method iterates over each element in the list from the first to the last.
- **Element Comparison**: During each iteration, it checks if the current element is equal to the target element using the `equals` method.
- **Return Value**: If a match is found, it returns true immediately. If no match is found by the end of the list, it returns false.

### 7. `indexOf(E element)`

**Pseudocode:**
- For each index from 0 to `size-1`:
  - If the element at the current index equals the target element, return the index.
- Return -1 if the target element is not found.

**Explanation:**
- **Loop Through Elements**: The method checks each element in the list starting from the first element.
- **Check for Equality**: If the current element is equal to the target element (considering `null` values), the index of that element is returned.
- **Element Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding the element, -1 is returned indicating that the element is not present in the list.

### 8. `size()`

**Pseudocode:**
- Return the current size of the list.

**Explanation:**
- **Size Retrieval**: This method simply returns the value of the `size` field, which represents the number of elements currently in the list.

### 9. `isEmpty()`

**Pseudocode:**
- Return true if the size is 0, otherwise return false.

**Explanation:**
- **Check if Empty**: The method checks if the `size` field is 0. If it is, the method returns true, indicating that the list is empty. Otherwise, it returns false.

### 10. `clear()`

**Pseudocode:**
- For each element in the array, set the element to null.
- Set the size to 0.

**Explanation:**
- **Clearing Elements**: Iterates over the array that backs the list, setting each slot to null to remove all references to the stored elements.
- **Reset Size**: Sets the `size` field to 0, effectively clearing the list.

### 11. `ensureCapacity()`

**Pseudocode:**
- If the size equals the capacity:
  - Calculate a new capacity (typically 1.5 times the old capacity plus one).
  - Create a new array with the new capacity.
  - Copy elements from the old array to the new array.
  - Update the reference from the old array to the new array.
  - Update the capacity field.

**Explanation:**
- **Capacity Check**: Checks if the list is full by comparing the `size` with the `capacity`.
- **Resize if Necessary**: If the list is full, it calculates a new, larger capacity and creates a new array of this size. Then, it copies all elements from the old array to the new one.
- **Update References and Capacity**: Sets the list's internal array reference to the new array and updates the `capacity` field to the new capacity value.
